# This is the Python Challenge assignment for the Monash Data Analytics Bootcamp.

The requirements for this assignment can be found at the following link. https://monash.bootcampcontent.com/monash-coding-bootcamp/monu-virt-data-11-2021-u-c/-/blob/master/02-Homework/03-Python/Instructions/README.md

The Files providing the solution to the Python Challenge are the following.
1.	"pybank/main" contains a text file of the Python code for the Pybank part of the challenge. 
2.	"pypoll/main" contains a text file of the Python code for the Pypoll part of the challenge. 
3.	"pybank/analysis” contains the “budget_analysis” output file produced for the Pybank part of the challenge to verify that it works correctly.
4.	"pybank/screenshot” shows the terminal output for the Pybank part of the challenge to verify that it works correctly.
5.	"pypoll/analysis” contains the “election_analysis” output file produced for the Pypoll part of the challenge to verify that it works correctly.
6.	"pypoll/screenshot” shows the terminal output for the Pypoll part of the challenge to verify that it works correctly.

Github "push" is limited to 50KB in the standard version of Github installed via the Bootcamp installation instructions, so we are unable to load the "election_data" file required for the analysis, which is approximately 73KB.

The "election_data" file required for the analysis can be found at the following link.
